=============================

Various utility dongles that have uses in many projects:

* USB-to-UART adapter based on the FTDI FT231XS
* Lithium polymer USB battery charger based on the Microchip MCP73831
* DC-to-DC SEPIC converter based on the Linear LT1610

Yes, all of these are available elsewhere for cheaper, on platforms that have had better testing, etc. Don't use them for anything you care about, really, since this is more CAD practice for myself.

Eventually will be a single unit for handling power and UART communications with a microcontroller.
